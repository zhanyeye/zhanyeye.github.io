# **discussions-to-blog**

A GitHub Action that syncs GitHub Discussions from specific categories into Markdown files, making it easy to incorporate the discussions into static site generators like Hugo or Jekyll. Additionally, this action commits and pushes the changes to your repository.

---

## **Inputs**

| Input Name         | Description                                                     | Required | Default                   |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------------------------|
| `categories`       | A comma-separated list of discussion categories to convert to Markdown posts (e.g., `Announcements, General`). | Yes      | N/A                       |
| `output_dir`       | Directory where the Markdown files will be saved.              | Yes      | `content/posts`           |
| `branch`           | The branch to which changes should be committed and pushed.    | Yes      | N/A                       |
| `commit_message`   | The commit message for the changes.                            | No       | `Sync Discussions to Markdown` |

## **How It Works**

1. The action fetches discussions from the specified GitHub categories.
2. It converts those discussions into Markdown files and saves them in the defined `output_dir`.
3. It stages, commits, and pushes the updated Markdown files to the specified `branch` using the [`stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action`](https://github.com/stefanzweifel/git-auto-commit-action).
4. The entire workflow is automated and integrates seamlessly into your GitHub repository.

## **Example Usage**

Here’s how you can use this action in your GitHub Actions workflow file:

```yaml
name: Sync Discussions to Blog

on:
  discussion:  
    types: [created, edited, deleted]  

jobs:  
  sync-discussions-to-blog:  
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  
    
    steps:  
      - name: Checkout repository  
        uses: actions/checkout@v3  

      - name: Sync Discussions  
        uses: ./.github/actions/discussions-to-blog
        with:   
          categories: "Announcements, General"
          output_dir: "content/posts"
          branch: main
          commit_message: "Sync Discussions to Markdown"
```

### **Inputs Breakdown**

#### **`categories`**
- Required: ✅
- A comma-separated list of discussion categories to process (e.g., `"Announcements, General"`). Discussions within these categories will be converted into Markdown posts.

#### **`output_dir`**
- Required: ✅
- Specifies the directory in your repository where the Markdown files will be output. For example, Hugo blogs usually use `content/posts`.

#### **`branch`**
- Required: ✅
- The branch where the changes (new or updated Markdown files) will be committed and pushed. This parameter ensures the ability to commit directly to a specific branch (e.g., `main`).

#### **`commit_message`**
- Required: ❌
- The message that will accompany the commit. Defaults to `"Sync Discussions to Markdown"` if not provided.
